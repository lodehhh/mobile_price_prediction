# MOBILE PRICE PREDICTION USING DEEP NEURAL NETWORK

## Description

Creating a model to predict mobile price based on the characteristics. I'll be using tensorflow keras to do deep neural network. __Deep neural network represents the type of machine learning when the system uses many layers of nodes to derive high-level functions from input information. It means transforming the data into a more creative and abstract component.__
This model is expected could facilitate a company to decide what price mobile phone belongs to their characteristics. So the price is relevance compared to the other company.
This model is expected could optimize and boost productivity of employees.
